// Problem 1:
// Create a class Product that represents a product sold online. A product has a price, quantity and name.
//The class should have a method that prints a product's information in the following format: Banana, price 1.1, amount 13.
//Create two instances of the class and call the method created to print the product's details.

// Problem 2:
// Define a class called Pet with three properties, type, breed and age.
//Create a method called formatProperties that prints all object properties using string templating. 
//Create a method called changeAge that takes a number and updates the age property of an object. 
//Create a method called dogYears that checks if the pet type of the object is dog, if so return the age in dog years (age times 7), otherwise return the message "[PET TYPE] is not a dog!".
//Create an instance of the Pet Class called pet1. Print all property values of the object using the class method. 
//Create another instance of the Pet Class with diffrent property values called pet2. Print all property values of the object using the class method. Change the age grade of pet1. 
//Print the age of pet1 in dog years using the class method. Print the age of pet2 in dog years using the class method

// Problem 3: Inheritance
// Create a Person Class with the properties Name (first, last), Age, Interests, Bio ('NAME is AGE years old. They like INTERESTS')
// Create a class called Student that extends Person and adds the property Cohort to student.
// Create a class called Teacher that extends Person and adds the properties subject, and students (students should be an array of Student objects) 
//Create a method called addStudent that takes an instance of Student and adds a student object to the students array.
// Create a method called listAllStudents that prints every student name and student cohort associated with a teacher.
// Create an instance of the Teacher class called teacher1 with an empty student array. 
//Create another instance of this class called teacher2 with an empty student array. Add two students to teacher1 using the class method. 
//Add two students to teacher2 using the class method. List all students associated with teacher1 using the class method. 
//List all studnets associated with teacher2 using the class method.
